Automation Script for Atech ASN Generation

This script was developed by me to be used with iMacros on Firefox. It uses powershell to generate a macro on the fly
using data from a CSV imported from our database. This is then used to generate ASN requests for ATech on their site.

You may use this code as you wish and improvements are very much welcomed however without the CSV example it may be difficult
to find the correct format.
